            <li>Human controls matreshki</li>
            <li>AI controls androids</li>
            <li>Game map is split to 25 areas</li>
            <li>Each area is under control of some player initially:
                <ol>
                    <li>Moscow area is under control of matreshki</li>
                    <li>Other GDD hosting areas are under control of androids</li>
                    <li>Remaining areas are arranged among players randomly in 3:1 (androids:matreshki) relation</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>There is a unit in each area: matreshka or android.</li>
            <li>Units have different sizes: there are 8 levels of unit size</li>
            <li>Human player makes first turn</li>
            <li>While player has turn on, he can make any number of attacks</li>
            <li>To attack, player must click source area and then click target area:
                <ol>
                    <li>Source and target areas must be adjacent</li>
                    <li>Source area must belong to current player</li>
                    <li>Target area must belong to enemy player</li>
                    <li>Source area must have unit of at least 2'nd level</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Attack happens automatically in the next order:
                <ol>
                    <li>Each player is rolling the dices</li>
                    <li>Number of dices equals to level of corresponding unit</li>
                    <li>Dices' points are summed</li>
                    <li>If attacking player has more points, then he wins the battle:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Attacking player captures the area</li>
                            <li>Attacking unit's level is decreased by 1 and he moves to captured area</li>
                            <li>Attacking area gets the unit of 1'st level</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Else attacking player retreats:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Attacking area's unit is weakened to 1'st level</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Player can click "End Turn" button if he doesn't want to attack anymore:
                <ol>
                    <li>Current player gets reinforcements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The maximum number of joined areas under player's control is calculated</li>
                            <li>Random units under player's control grow by the same number of levels</li>
                            <li>No units grow over 8'th level</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Another player starts his turn</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If player secures all GDD hosting areas, he wins the game</li>
