        <h1>Matreshki vs Androids</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Androids got out of control and captured all <a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/2011/">Google Developer Day 2011</a> hosting locations except Moscow. The only way to save the feast is to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">Russian matreshki</a> to fix the androids up before all the GDD hosting locations are captured.</p>
        <h2>Goals of the game</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Secure all Google Developer Day hosting locations</li>
            <li>Don't let the Androids capture all the Google Developer Day hosting locations</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Game rules</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 players participate in the game: human vs computer</li>
            <li>The human player controls the matreshki</li>
            <li>The computer player controls the androids</li>
            <li>The game map is split into 25 areas</li>
            <li>Each area is under the control of some player initially:
                <ol>
                    <li>Moscow area is under the control of the matreshki</li>
                    <li>Other Google Developer Day hosting areas are under the control of the androids</li>
                    <li>The remaining areas are randomly split among both players, in a 3:1 ratio (androids:matreshki)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>There is a unit in each area: either a matreshka or an android</li>
            <li>Units have different sizes, ranging from level 1 up to level 8</li>
            <li>The human player starts out by making the first turn</li>
            <li>During a players turn, that player can make any number of attacks</li>
            <li>To attack, the player must click a source area and then click target area:
                <ol>
                    <li>The source and the target areas must be adjacent to each other</li>
                    <li>The source area must belong to current player</li>
                    <li>The target area must belong to enemy player</li>
                    <li>The source area must have unit of at least 2nd level in it</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Battle happens automatically in the following order:
                <ol>
                    <li>Each player rolls an amount of dice equal to the level of the corresponding unit (this happens automatically)</li>
                    <li>The pips (numbers) on the dice are tallied together to build a total point value</li>
                    <li>If the attacking player has more points, then he wins the battle:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Attacking player captures the area</li>
                            <li>Attacking unit's level is decreased by 1 and it moves to the captured area</li>
                            <li>The area the attack came from retains a 1st level unit</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Otherwise, the attacking player has to retreat:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Attacking area's unit is knocked down to a 1st level unit</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A player can click the "End turn" button if he doesn't want to attack anymore:
                <ol>
                    <li>The current player gets reinforcements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The maximum number of joined (adjacent) areas under a player's control is calculated into reinforcement points</li>
                            <li>Based on the reinforcement value, units that player controls randomly gain levels until all reinforcement points have been exhausted</li>
                            <li>No unit can grow beyond the 8th level</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The next player starts his turn</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If a player secures all Google Developer Day hosting areas, he wins the game</li>
            <li>Game difficulty is grown with each victory</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>How we developed this game</h2>
        <p>This game was developed for participation in Google Open Call for Google Developer Day 2011 Challenge - Doodle the Dymaxion Map.<p>
